# Valentine's Day Project ❤️

This project is a personalized Valentine's Day gift for your girlfriend.

## How to Run

1.  Make sure you are inside the `Valentine` folder (which you likely are).

2.  Install dependencies (if needed):
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  Open the link shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`) in your browser.

## How to Add Your Images

1.  Open `src/App.jsx`.
2.  Search for `const images = [...]`.
3.  Replace the `url` properties with links to your photos.
    - You can use online URLs (like from Imgur, Google Photos, Unsplash).
    - Or, you can put your images in the `public/` folder and use local paths like `/my-photo.jpg`.

## Customizing the Letter

-   Open `src/App.jsx`.
-   Find the `Letter` component to update the message.

Enjoy! ❤️
